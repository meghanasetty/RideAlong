# RideAlong

The application is for entertainment where you can find new people when you are travelling to a new place. You can get their experiences about the location, give a review where others can agree or disagree which makes the review worthy and they can then decide of visiting the location. There is a security feature where you can share your location and your loved ones can monitor you and make you feel secure. The backend is done using Node.js and MySQL.
